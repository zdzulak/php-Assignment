	Overall I found that the project was fairly simple to do. I had some troubles with my delete.php, the 404 error was unclear to me at the time and didn't make sense as I thought it was in the proper file. I learned that I should keep track of where each file is as it was in a seperate folder where it was inaccessible. I also had trouble with edit which I am still unclear with what the problem is, if you find out please let me know in feedback. Otherwise the rest of the project was fairly easy to create, databases are pretty easy to do, both locally hosted and live, and sending information from the php to the database is understandable.
